# Credit Card Fraud Detection

þProject Overview

This project aims to develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to handle class imbalance in the dataset and aims to achieve high accuracy and recall rates for 

þ Dataset

The dataset used for this project is  available on Kaggle.

### Features

- **V1 to V28**: PCA-transformed features representing transaction data.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Time**: The elapsed time between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **Class**: Target variable (1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 for non-fraudulent transactions).


þResults

After running the model, you will get:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Accuracy Score

ROC-AUC Score

These metrics will provide insights into the model's performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.

þConclusion

The developed model can effectively identify fraudulent transactions with a focus on maintaining a balance between precision and recall. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
